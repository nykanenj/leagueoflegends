# League Of Legends Keybindings

These are the keybindings I use for league of legends. 

##Tips For Configuring

The important files (input.ini, PersistedSettings.json) found by default in C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Config

Apparently PersistedSettings.json is the more important file but it is kept server-side. Use C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\DATA\CFG\defaults\SettingsToPersist.json to configure the server-side file or make configurations through the LOL client in-game.

However it is unclear how to configure SettingsToPersist.json, so one option is to make PersistedSettings.json Read-Only. This way it will not be overwritten by whatever is on the riot servers...

## Goals

Least strain on hand  
Access to all important commands from defalut QWER position  
Ability to combine (E.g. Tilde for attackChampionsOnly and Alt for HoldPosition)  

## Keymapping Highlights:

- **Alt** to hold position.

- **F1 - F4** to show show allies instead of **F2 - F5**

- **Space** as lock screen toggle. Works also for centering on your champ.

- Free up **Tab** -> To be rebound to something more important. Scoreboard now shown by **F4** or **Mouse 4** (Forward button)

- Pings now done through **Mouse 5**  

## Keymapping Details

**F1 - F4** remapping is very nice because having **F1** to focus on yourself is a waste and **F1 - F4** are much easier to press than **F2 - F5** when scanning allies

**Space** as lock stcreen toggle: testing this out. Nice to use for two purpuses as the toggle and centering on your champ.

**Mouse 4** and **Mouse 5** are set to low priority stuff like pings and scoreboard. I feel my mouse hand is already over stressed and having to use these for important things would cause undue stress on hands.

## Other settings changes

- Auto target / keep auto attacking off
- Screenshake off
- AllChat on
- Show experience gained as text on champ
- Enable targeted attack move on (attack move on target that is closest to cursor instead of closest to champion)
- Slight decrease of mouse cursor scale (Be more precise with this on?)
- Player stats on
- Swap Button 1 and Button 2 and related HUD settings. (Button 1 = move, Button 2 = attack move) (Unfortunately this change likely means shop buttons are in reverse)
