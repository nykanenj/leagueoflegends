# League Of Legends Keybindings

These are the keybindings I use for league of legends. 

##Tips For Configuring

The important files (input.ini, PersistedSettings.json) found by default in C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Config

Apparently PersistedSettings.json is the more important file but it is kept server-side. Use C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\DATA\CFG\defaults\SettingsToPersist.json to configure the server-side file or make configurations through the LOL client in-game.

However it is unclear how to configure SettingsToPersist.json, so one option is to make PersistedSettings.json Read-Only. This way it will not be overwritten by whatever is on the riot servers... There are some hints in the version history of SettingsToPersist.json in this repo, but they are unverified, just some stuff I found on the internet. The latest file should always be a verified working version.

## Goals

Least strain on hand  
Access to all important commands from defalut QWER position  
Ability to combine (E.g. Tilde for attackChampionsOnly and Alt for HoldPosition)  

## Keymapping Highlights:

- **Alt** to hold position.

- **F1 - F4** to show show allies instead of **F2 - F5**

- **Space** as lock screen toggle. Works also for centering on your champ.

- Free up **Tab** -> To be rebound to something more important. Scoreboard now shown by **F4** or **Mouse 4** (Forward button)

- Pings now done through **Mouse 5**  

## Keymapping Details

**F1 - F4** remapping is very nice because having **F1** to focus on yourself is a waste and **F1 - F4** are much easier to press than **F2 - F5** when scanning allies

**Space** as lock stcreen toggle: testing this out. Nice to use for two purpuses as the toggle and centering on your champ.

**Mouse 4** and **Mouse 5** are set to low priority stuff like pings and scoreboard. I feel my mouse hand is already over stressed and having to use these for important things would cause undue stress on hands.

## Other settings changes

- Auto target / keep auto attacking off
- Screenshake off
- AllChat on
- Show experience gained as text on champ
- Enable targeted attack move on (attack move on target that is closest to cursor instead of closest to champion)
- Slight decrease of mouse cursor scale (Be more precise with this on?)
- Player stats on
- Swap Button 1 and Button 2 and related HUD settings. (Button 1 = move, Button 2 = attack move) (Unfortunately this change likely means shop buttons are in reverse)
